        <h3>Motto</h3>
        <p>“We can make a Difference. We must make a Difference.”</p>
        <p>Saathi is a non-governmental organization established in 1992 to address the different forms of violence and discrimination faced by Nepali women and girls. It was the first organization that was instrumental in drawing significant national attention towards domestic violence in Nepal as an area requiring urgent attention and intervention to break the silence that impacts the lives of many marginalized women and girls. It has persistently continued its crusade for creating a safe and violence-free society where women and children can live with respect and dignity.</p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>“A just and peaceful society where individuals can enjoy their fundamental rights to lead a violence-free life regardless of their sex and gender”</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>“Create violence free homes and society where women and children can live a life of dignity”</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>To reduce violence against women and children through awareness, research, advocacy, and empowerment
          Institutionalize good governance through organizational strengthening and development
          Provide support to women and children survivors of violence
          Build the capacity of women and children for empowerment and sustenance
          Advocate for gender equality, human rights and women’s rights
          Engage in community development and social mobilization initiatives
          </p>
          <h3>Institutional landscape</h3>
          <p>Saathi has a family of 75 staff members (74% female) working across the country. Saathi’s head office is in Lalitpur District, while its district offices are in Kathmandu, Banke, Kapilvastu, Kanchanpur and Bardiya with also presence in Kailali, Baglung, Pokhara, Dang, Dadeldhura, Sindhupalchowk, Bajhang, Achham, Dolkha, Makwanpur, Siraha, and Mahottari. Nevertheless, Saathi’s outreach is beyond the areas where it has physical presence and nationwide as Saathi believes in partnering with and capacitating already existing community organizations at the local level.</p>
